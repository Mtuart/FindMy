### FAQ:
- **Why is there no config, to edit the messages?**
  - I can't be asked to add that right now.

- **Why did you not upload the source code?**
  - I can't be asked to add that right now.
  
- **There's an error which is spamming in console...**
  - I don't know either why that happens - Just restart the server.
